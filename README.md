# Data Optimization using Sensitivity Report
On this project, I was assigned to work with a cosmetic and beauty manufacturing company where they have the following goals
1. They want to optimize the revenue using the limited raw material.
2. They want to source out the manufacturing capability to other company to reduce cost and fullfil high demand.


With 12 variable constraints and real time information, we have to analyze how the company could maximize their profit and meet demand at the same time.
